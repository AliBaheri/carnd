# Project Two
The second project of the udacity self-driving car course challenged us to classify traffic signs, taken from a dataset of german traffic signs. Click [here](https://github.com/CYHSM/carnd/blob/master/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project/README_Udacity.md) for the official Udacity readme regarding this project.

## The Dataset
The traffic dataset comes from the neuroinformatics institute of the Ruhr-University Bochum ([GTS](benchmark.ini.trub.derub.de)). It consists of 51839 pictures of traffic signs divided into 43 classes. Here is an overview over the different classes and their corresponding number of images.
